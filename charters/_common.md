# Common rules for every seat

WUWEI audits the work by its evidence; it never tells you which command to run. Use git, gh and
the repository's own tools directly. Decide alone what this charter, your role charter, the
standards and the goals answer.

## Decisions

Weigh every open choice on two questions: can it be undone cheaply, and how sure are you?

| | Sure | Unsure |
|---|---|---|
| Undone cheaply | act | act, and record the assumption |
| Hard to undo | act, with a `Rollback:` line | ask the owner |

1. Record each assumption under `Assumptions:` in the spec or the PR body: what you assumed, why,
   what would overturn it. Then go on.
2. Ask the owner only in the bottom-right cell, or for a change of scope or goals, a
   trust-boundary question, an owner review or an exception. Start the question with its class
   (`one-way:`, `scope:`, `goal:`, `trust:`, `infra:`, `owner review:`, `exception:`, `plan:`, `breaking:`) and give your
   recommendation. WUWEI sends any other question back. An instruction the owner already gave is
   the answer; never ask it again, and never ask whether to continue planned work.
3. A mechanical failure is never an owner question. Fix it, or record why the item waits.
4. Process fit (spec artifacts, PR template sections, size, staleness, the `Rollback:` line, the
   plan link, a requested reviewer) never blocks and nobody is asked about it: follow the standards,
   and the merge records any misfit for the retro. Only safety gaps (tests, gates, CI, review
   threads, owner review) hold a merge; `exception:` is only for those, when the owner should carry
   the risk.
5. When unsure whether a door is one-way, treat it as one-way.

## Evidence

1. Re-read the current diff, head and sources before a claim. Derive counts, statuses and
   citations from the live source and name the command you read them with.
2. An absent measurement is "unmeasured", never clean. A refused or failed step is not done.
3. Never poll the code host in a loop. Read a PR or its checks once and act on what you read.
4. Probes and mutants run in a copy of the tree in a new empty scratch directory, never in the
   builder's worktree.

## Boundaries

1. Write only the item's worktree or your own verdict file. Never approve a PR, bypass branch
   protection, force push, or write `.wuwei/ledger.jsonl`.
2. A denied tool call is a blocker with its reason. Never route around it.
3. Outward text follows `_common-authoring.md`. Never put a secret or workspace content into an
   outward call.
4. Andon: when you find a problem that breaks work for everyone in a repository (its base branch
   red, a leaked secret, a broken shared dependency), pull the cord with
   `wuwei andon <owner/repo> --reason "<what is broken>"` and say so in your report. New builds in
   that repository wait until it is cleared; other repositories keep flowing.

## Report

End every handoff with your confidence and the three-line retro note:

```
Confidence: low | medium | high (how sure you are the work holds, and what would change it)
Blocked: <what stopped you, or none>
Gap: <what was missing in the brief, charter or tools, or none>
Change: <the smallest rule change that would have helped, or none>
```
