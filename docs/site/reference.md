# Operator data reference

Use `bin/wuwei` from the installed checkout, or `python3 -P -m wuwei` with the package on `PYTHONPATH`. The `-P` option keeps a local `wuwei/` directory from shadowing the CLI.

## Lead plan JSON

Run `bin/wuwei plan template` in a workspace for a complete lead JSON skeleton. `bin/wuwei plan template | bin/wuwei plan propose -` creates today's proposal. Replace sample evidence before approval. The top-level keys are:

| Key | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `goals` | Nonempty list of `G-n` identifiers in `.wuwei/memory/goals.md`. |
| `candidates` | List of candidate objects described below. |
| `seat_policy` | Role to `{ "runtime": "claude", "model": "sonnet" }` mapping. |
| `envelope` | `start`, `end`, and nonnegative `net_build_hours`. |
| `sweep` | Source to measured or unmeasured status string. |
| `cap` | Positive running build seat count, within `host.seats`. |

Each candidate needs a unique `id`, a confirmed `goal` or `unplanned`, `evidence`, `scope`, `overlap`, `track`, `flags`, `score`, and `evidence_lines`. `track` is `SLICE` for a small change with one pre-PR gate set, or `FULL` when a spec-done gate is needed. `flags` has exactly three booleans: `trust_surface`, `boundary_relevant`, and `agent_surface`. These affect owner routing and security gates. `evidence_lines` has a nonempty one-line citation for every score component.

`bin/wuwei rank template` prints a candidate list for the configured framework. Pass it to `bin/wuwei rank -` to inspect the order. Ties use goal priority, then candidate id.

### WSJF and RICE

For `prioritisation.framework = "wsjf"`, `score` contains `value`, `time_criticality`, `risk_reduction`, and `job_size`. Each uses the Fibonacci scale 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20. WSJF is `(value + time_criticality + risk_reduction) / job_size`.

For `prioritisation.framework = "rice"`, use `reach` (positive people or systems), `impact` (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3), `confidence` (0.5, 0.8, 1), and `effort` (positive seat-days). RICE is `reach * impact * confidence / effort`.

## Decision record

`bin/wuwei decision template` prints a record that passes `bin/wuwei decision lint FILE`. Save it as `.wuwei/days/<date>/decisions/D-<n>.md`. Include `Question:`, `Context:` with evidence paths, and an `Options:` table with at least two choices including deferral. A `Musts:` table marks pass/fail for each option. A `Wants:` table gives each criterion a weight from 1 to 10 and each option a score from 0 to 10. `Recommendation:` names the highest scoring option that passes every must. Complete `Confidence: high|medium|low`, `Reversibility: one-way|two-way`, `Blast radius:`, `Pre-mortem:`, `Revisit:`, `Decided-by: seat|owner`, and `Outcome:`. Route an existing record with `bin/wuwei decision route D-<n>`.

## Retro and merge configuration

Every seat ends with three retro note keys on separate lines: `Blocked:`, `Gap:`, and `Change:`. Use `none` if a line has no finding. In `.wuwei/config.toml`, `[retro]` sets `repo` (default `"."`), `charter_paths` (default `[".wuwei/charters"]`), and `changelog` (default `".wuwei/memory/CHANGELOG.md"`).

In a `[[repos]]` entry, `[repos.merge]` sets `merge.auto` (default `false`). Automatic merge remains subject to measured policy, review, checks, soak and path rules. Set `repos.merge_deploys` correctly; WUWEI never deploys.

## Codex companion protocol

Configure `codex.command` as an argv list and `codex.timeout_seconds` in `.wuwei/config.toml`. The adapter invokes `task`, `status`, `result`, and `cancel` with `--json` in the worktree. `task --fresh --background` starts a job and returns `jobId`; continuation uses `task --resume-last --background --write`. `status JOB_ID` returns `workspaceRoot` and a `job` with its own `workspaceRoot` and status. Both roots must resolve to the requested worktree. `result JOB_ID` supplies text in `storedJob.result.rawOutput`, with companion stdout or rendered text as fallback. A root mismatch triggers `cancel JOB_ID`. Missing fields, an error body or a timeout is unmeasured and fails closed.

## Outward draft queue

Approve-tier replies through the chat, code-host comment and tracker-create adapters are stored in today's producer-owned `drafts` state. The call returns exit 1 with the draft ID and sends nothing. Policy or security errors still fail closed. Ordinary adapter calls never treat a saved owner decision as permission to send.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/wuwei drafts` | List today's pending drafts with text, destination, audience and tier reason. |
| `bin/wuwei drafts approve <id>` | Run security, outward and voice lint, then send the stored text once through its original adapter operation. |
| `bin/wuwei drafts approve <id> --edit` | Edit with `EDITOR` (default `vi`), lint the final text, then send it. |
| `bin/wuwei drafts drop <id>` | Close the draft without sending. |

Approval and drop are owner actions on the host terminal. Agent tool hooks refuse both, including registered seats. The cockpit displays pending drafts and the approval command read-only; it accepts no POST actions. Host-only enforcement follows the existing cooperative hook threat model in spec 9.1, not an operating-system identity boundary.

Single-field replies edit as plain text. Multi-field tracker drafts edit as a JSON object of text fields such as `draft.title` and `draft.description`; field names and destination metadata cannot be changed through the editor. The stored record preserves original and final inputs and text. Events contain IDs and outcome metadata, not message bodies. Reply bodies remain in local day state for owner review.

A successful send closes the draft. Repeated or competing approvals cannot send it again. Lint or editor failure leaves it pending. A send attempt with a failed or interrupted outcome remains `failed` or `sending` and cannot be retried through approval; inspect the destination before taking further action. Changing the configured adapter or DM destination also refuses replay. Cross-day browsing and transport reconciliation are deferred.

`bin/wuwei metrics` includes `voice_drafts`, grouped by the draft's voice audience: `sent`, `share_sent_unedited`, and `edit_sizes` for edited successful sends. Edit size counts changed characters using matched spans, with a replacement counted as the larger removed or inserted span. Dropped, pending, failed and interrupted drafts are excluded. No successful sends reports `unmeasured`. No new configuration keys are needed.

## Item worktrees

After the morning gate, create each code item's worktree with `bin/wuwei worktree add <item>`. Pass `--repo <name>` when `.wuwei/config.toml` configures more than one `[[repos]]` entry. The command creates `worktrees/<item>` in the workspace on a new branch named after the item in lower case, starting from the repository's current HEAD. It installs the managed pre-commit and pre-push hooks and the workspace anchor, then prints JSON with `branch` and `path`. Pass that `path` to `bin/wuwei brief ... --worktree`. Without gate approval it exits 1 and creates nothing.

A worktree made with raw `git worktree add` has no anchor. Its commits and pushes outside the Claude Bash hook skip the WUWEI guards.

## Seat briefs

```text
bin/wuwei brief <charter> <item> <name> [--worktree PATH] [--gate] [--track SLICE|FULL] [--pr OWNER/REPO#N] < body.md
```

The brief body is read from stdin. The first argument is a charter name: `lead`, `builder`, `shepherd`, `sentinel-arch`, `sentinel-quality`, `sentinel-security`, `sentinel-goal` or `steward`. `dispatch next` and `dispatch receive` use the gate role instead: `arch`, `quality`, `security` or `goal`. A gate body must not ask for an inline verdict or restate the verdict path; the brief adds it. A `Paths:` line lists extra paths for the SLICE protected-path check. The command prints the brief path. Each seat name gets one brief.

## Item phase order

`bin/wuwei state transition` accepts only these moves. `parked` and `escalated` resume only to the recorded prior phase.

| Phase | Legal next phases |
| --- | --- |
| `planned` | spec, implement, parked, escalated |
| `spec` | implement, parked, escalated |
| `implement` | gate, parked, escalated |
| `gate` | raised, fix, parked, escalated |
| `fix` | delta, parked, escalated |
| `delta` | raised, fix, parked, escalated |
| `raised` | fix, merged, parked, escalated |
| `parked` | planned, spec, implement, gate, raised, fix, delta |
| `escalated` | planned, spec, implement, gate, raised, fix, delta |
| `merged` | none |

## Gate verdict layout

A quality verdict with one finding that `bin/wuwei verdict lint FILE --role sentinel-quality` accepts:

```text
# Quality verdict ITEM-1

Verdict: FIX
Head: 3f1c2ab9e0d4

- Q1 medium src/calc.py:19: the test accepts any ValueError, so a regression that raises one from a different cause would still pass. blocks: yes
Probe: mutation changed the guard message; the test still passed.

Simplicity: none, one guard and one division.
Design: none, a single pure function.

VAL: FINDING Q1
TEST: FINDING Q1
BUD: N.A. no external calls

Blocked: none
Gap: none
Change: none
```

The lint rules:

- Exactly one `Verdict: PASS|FIX|PARK|ESCALATE` line and one `Head: <7 to 40 hex>` row.
- A `Probe:` or `Mutation:` line; write `not run` when the seat could not run one.
- `Blocked:`, `Gap:` and `Change:` once each.
- Quality adds exactly one `Simplicity:` and one `Design:` row.
- Arch, quality and security add class-sweep lines such as `VAL: PASS`, `TEST: N.A.` or `AUTH: FINDING <id>`.
- A non-PASS verdict needs at least one finding. A PASS verdict carries no `blocks: yes` finding.
- A finding starts on a bullet or table row, a line beginning with its severity, a `Severity:` line, or a numbered or `F1` line.
- Each finding carries a severity (P0 to P3, critical, high, medium, low or info), a `file:line` (or `Lnn` for docs), `blocks: yes|no`, and a failure scenario (for example "fails when", "would" or "impact").
- Fenced blocks, quoted lines and HTML comments are ignored.
